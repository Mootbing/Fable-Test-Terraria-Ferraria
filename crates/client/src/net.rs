//! WebSocket facade over the `web/quad_ws.js` miniquad plugin
//! (docs/NETWORKING.md). Binary frames carry postcard-encoded protocol
//! messages; everything is polled from the frame loop — no threads on wasm.
//!
//! The client ships wasm-only. The native build keeps a stub that fails to
//! connect and reports a permanently closed socket, so the crate still
//! compiles for tooling on the host target.

// next pending message length (or -1 if none); recv copies the next message
// into (ptr, cap) returning bytes written (or -1); default_url writes the
// location-derived ws URL into (ptr, cap) returning bytes written (or -1).
